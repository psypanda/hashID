Identify the different types of hashes used to encrypt data and especially passwords.

This replaces `hash-identifier <http://code.google.com/p/hash-identifier/>`__, which
is outdated!

This *web-version* of hashID aims to replace the requirement of installing python and to
update the dictionary of supported hashes that can be identified by the original
`hashID <https://github.com/psypanda/hashID/>` which has not been maintained for nearly
4 years.

Identify hashes on any system with a browser and even share your findings! Appending
`?hashes=<comma separated list>` as the query params will allow you to share the findings.
A button to copy the shareable-link to your clipboard can be found at the bottom of the results.
